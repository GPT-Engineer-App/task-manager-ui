# task-manager-ui

Header: Create a header with the logo on the left and user profile/settings icons on the right. The logo should read “Forskningsrådet”.
Sidebar: Design a sidebar with various icons representing different sections of the application. The icons should be intuitive and representative of the sections they lead to.
Main Content Area: The main content area should be titled “Mine oppgaver” (My Tasks). This area should display a table of tasks with the following columns:
“Tittel” (Title)
“Ordning”
“Prosjekt/kontrakt”
“Organisasjon”
“Frist” (Deadline)
Each row in the table represents a task with details filled in each column. Deadlines should be highlighted in red text.
Buttons: Below the table, create two buttons labeled “Søknader” (Applications) and “Prosjekter” (Projects). These buttons should display the total count of applications and projects respectively.
